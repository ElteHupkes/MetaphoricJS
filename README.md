MetaphoricJS
============

A new, simplified Metaphoric.nl written using a combo of CakePHP for the backend and Ember.js for the rest.

I want to see how conveniently I can develop a frontend web application. My requirements:
- Easy form generation using data retrieved by a JSON api. I'm combining existing helpers for this, and writing
  my own code (see js/lib/Mp/)
- Easy internationalization (i18n), I'm using ember-i18n but am curious if I can combine it with the desired helpers.
